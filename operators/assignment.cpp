2. Assignment Operators   
Challenge: Write a program that allows a user to input the number of tea bags they have. 
Assign additional bags to them based on certain conditions (e.g., if they have fewer
     than 10 bags, give them 5 extra). Update the original number using assignment operators. 

     +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
